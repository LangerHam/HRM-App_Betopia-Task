## üìù Notes on Assumptions / Shortcuts

- I did simplify authentication ‚Äî the login page accepts any credentials and just stores a mock user + token in Redux. This way, I could implement route protection and state handling without wiring up a full auth system.  
- Had to fix ESLint and TypeScript issues (no-explicit-any, no-empty-object-type, unused vars) so that the project builds successfully on Vercel.  
- Changed the use of Tailwind‚Äôs `dark:` classes for theme switching, after realizing the `resolvedTheme` approach caused components like tables not to re-render properly.

## Bonus: Employees Screen

 Implemented an **Employees screen** under `/dashboard/employees`.\
- Displays employee data in a searchable, filterable, and sortable
table.\
- Integrates with the `useEmployees` hook for managing state and
deletion logic.
